# Computer Vision Analysis On Basketball Video

This project implements a basketball dribble detection system using computer vision techniques. It consists of several Python scripts for custom train the yolov8, detecting basketball dribbles, calculating dribble count and average dribble frequency, and displaying the results on video frames.

## Files

- **train_yolov8_object_detection_on_custom_dataset.ipynb**: This is a predifined notebook that contains functions and code that is used to custom train the yolov8 model using roboflow platform. Please visit https://github.com/roboflow/notebooks for more informations.

- **WHATSAAP_ASSIGNMENT.mp4**: This video file is used for custom train the yolov8 model and also used on analysis.

- **count_dribble.py**: This script contains a function to calculate dribble count and average dribble frequency based on predictions generated by a computer vision model.
  
- **draw_display.py**: This script contains a function to draw the basketball path and display dribble count and average dribble frequency on video frames.

- **main.py**: This is the main script that captures video frames, processes them using the functions from count_dribble.py and draw_display.py, and generates an output video with dribble count and statistics overlayed.

- **output.avi**: This is the output of this project.

- **WHATSAAP_train.avi**: This is the output of trained yolov8 model.

- **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python packages required for running the project along with their versions.

## Usage

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the `main.py` script to start the dribble detection system:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   Press 'q' to exit the application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11.1
- numpy==1.26.3
- opencv-python==4.9.0.80
- roboflow==1.1.19
- matplotlib==3.8.2
- matplotlib-inline==0.1.6
